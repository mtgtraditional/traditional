            Traditional is a format based on Modern; the regular Modern ban list still applies, with several
            additions to it:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Any card with the Planeswalker type is banned.

                <span class="italic">
                            This includes any cards that become, spawn, transform, rotate, flip, morph or
                            whatever new mechanics are thought of to bring another side of the card into
                            the game.

                Declaring a card as companion is banned.

                            Companion as a mechanic is banned in Traditional. You may still use the creature itself in your main deck or as a
                            sideboard slot.
                        </span>

                Why are mythic rares banned?
            </h3>
            <p>
                WotC originally stated that mythic rares were to be assigned to cards that "felt mythic" and
                <!-- @formatter:off -->
                unlikely to become format staples, e.g., Godsire.<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
                <!-- @formatter:on -->
                Instead, their intentions strayed when WotC began printing staples at mythic rare even if they
                didn't feel epic or deserving of mythic rare in order to push packs, driving up the costs of
                many decks. Examples of mythic rare cards that were obviously printed as such in order to sell
                packs include: Lotus Cobra; Warren Instigator for Goblin decks; and Scapeshift, which was
                upgraded from rare by WotC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, Richard Garfield feels that mythic rares were a
                <!-- @formatter:off -->
                mistake.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>

            <h3>Why not (un)ban [card]?</h3>
            <p>
                While we are aware that some may want certain cards from Modern to be unbanned, it would
                make the format more complex than necessary and difficult to follow.
                <br>
                When making exceptions to cards, we run the risk of creating a kitchen table
                ban list and not clearly defining the Traditional format; e.g.,
                <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/84/one-with-nothing">One with Nothing</a>
                is hardly powerful in Pauper, but since it was never a common, it cannot be played in
                Pauper due to its format's rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are considering the possibility of running our own ban list after the format gains traction.

            <h3>Why the Planeswalker ban?</h3>
            <p>
                Planeswalkers are banned because they represent a design within the game that inherently
                generates too much immediate value, and are difficult to remove or interact with. Some
                Planeswalkers, like Teferi, Time Raveler and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, have effects that
                bounce creatures or create creatures, giving them a built-in way to protect themselves the
                moment they hit the battlefield, and nullifying creatures as a form of removal for them. Because
                they are played at sorcery speed, the player playing them will have priority after playing them,
                allowing them to get value out of them before the other player has a chance to respond,
                effectively nullifying certain forms of interaction that the other player may have for them,
                such as Fry and Lightning Bolt. The only efficient removal for them require black (e.g.,
                Assassin's Trophy, The Elderspell, and Thoughtseize), meaning other colors are shafted in terms
                of having an effective way to deal with them. In addition,
                <!-- @formatter:off -->
                Richard Garfield himself dislikes Planeswalkers conceptually.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>
